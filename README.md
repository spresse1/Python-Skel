## Purpose

## Installation

## Use

## Dev installation

In the root directory, run:
```shell
pip install -U virtualenv
virtualenv .
. bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt -r dev-requirements.txt
```

## Documentation
To build the documentation, run:
`tox -e docs`

To build a target other than html, set the environment variable DOC_TARGET.  Valid values are the same as those for sphinx.

## Testing
To test, run either:

1. `tox` (preferred)
2. `py.test test`

This module should have a 100% test coverage and tests are set to fail if this is not the case.

### Modifying tests

All tests are currently located in tests/ and any tests using python's unittest module placed in this directory should run.
